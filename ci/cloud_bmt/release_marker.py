"""Release marker at ``gs://$BUCKET/_state/release.json``.

The release marker is the single source of truth tying together the four BMT
surfaces that a given git commit produced:

- **Cloud Run image**: manifest digest in Artifact Registry.
- **GCS plugins**: content-hash of the ``plugins/`` mirror as synced to the bucket.
- **PEX**: the ``bmt-vX.Y.Z`` tag whose release asset is what ``setup-bmt-pex`` resolves to.
- **Pulumi stack**: hash of ``pulumi stack export`` capturing current infra state.

Only the ``release.yml`` GitHub Actions workflow writes this marker. The
``Handoff / Plan`` job reads it and asserts that ``git_sha`` matches the
workflow's ``github.sha`` before dispatching the cloud workflow. A mismatch or
missing marker means ``release.yml`` did not complete for this commit and the
cloud pipeline would otherwise be running against stale artifacts — the
assertion fails loud with an actionable message.

See ``docs/architecture.md`` and ``.github/workflows/release.yml`` for the full
architecture.
